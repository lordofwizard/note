# Introduction to computer graphics.

* what is computer graphics.  
    Anything that is not text on display is treated as Computer Graphics.  
    It is like an branch of computer science which helps in making the information to the user more easy to read and stuff.

* Pixel / Pel.  
in computer graphics pictures or graphics objects are  represented as a collection of discrete picture elements called pixels. This pixel is the smalles screen element.

* Rasterization.  
    The Process of determining the appropriate pixels for representing picture or graphics object is knows as rasterization.

* Scan conversion.  
    the process of representing continenous picture or graphic object as a collection of discrete pixels is called scan conversion.

* Some basic things you should know.
    1. Pixel :- Smallest Element of DISPLAY.
    2. Resolution :- No of pixels on screen.
    3. Aspect Ratio :- Height to width Ratio of the screen / display.
    4. Frame buffers :- Temporary Storage to store some graphics elements.
* Advantages of **Computer Graphics**.   
    * User Interfaces.  
      Well representing information in user friendly way is always more effective and less time consuming that in single text format.
      Use of mouse >, more interaction with user.
    * Plotting Graphs and charts.   
      in industry , government, business, CG is used for making Piecharts graphs and histograms, **Helps in Decision Making Really**.
    * Desktop publishing & Office Automation.   
      DP allows discrimination and display of information in personal computer eays.   
      DP allows printing and of Scanned images and pictures. and also in organization helpful in showing  
      text tables graphcs and other stuff. **OFFICE AUTOMATION BABY**  
    * Computer Aided Drafting and design :-  
      CAD is used for making Electronics making electrical, mechanical and electro-mechanical diagrams and stuff. and to design components.  
      and for automobile bodies, stuctures of buildings, airplane, ships very large-scale integrated VLSI chips, optical systems and computer networks.  
    * Simulation and Animation :  
      For showing animated movies and Cartoons.  
      For showing real world simulation of construction site.  
    * Art and commerce :  
      Digital Art and Advertising.  
    * Process Control:-  
      Helpful in monitoring a remote machine in a userfriendly way.  
    * Cargography :-  
      Helpful in showing information of places and maps.  
    * Education and Training:-  
      Very helpful in showing educational graphics and models of physical systems in educational industry.

## DISPLAY DEVICES BABY.  
### CRT aka (Cathod Ray Tube) Displays.

* what the fuck is simulation  
  The use of a computer to represent the dynamic responses of one system by the behavior of another system modeled after it.
  
* CRT Diagram.  
    ![CRT](https://electronicspost.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/CRT-Block-diagram.png)   
    This is the diagram of CRT.  
    learn this diagram very important.

### Scanning Of Display Devices.

* Vector Scanning  
  In This vector scanning method, we can print a line going from point A to point B directly by moving the Electron Gun in the direction of propogation.  
  check out the diagram below.

#### Difference between Vector Scan and Raster Scan.

| Vector Scan                                                                                | Raster Scan                                                                                                                                |
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| In vector scan display the beam is moved between the end points of the graphics premitives | In raster scan display beam is moved all over the screen one scan line at a time from top to botton & then back to top                     |
| Scan conversion hardware is not required                                                   | Because each premitive must be scan converted, real time dynamics is far more computational and requires seperate scan conversion hardware |
| Vector display draws a contineous & smooth lines                                           | Raster scan display can display mathematically smooth lines polygona only by approximating them with pixel on the raster grid.             |
| cost is **MORE**                                                                           | Cost is **LESS**                                                                                                                           |
| Vector display only draws lines and characters                                             | Raster display has the ability to display areas with solid colours and patterns.                                                           |
